## Components

### **ProgressBar**

A visual representation of a savings goal's progress. It takes the current savings and target amount as input and displays the progress as a percentage.

#### Props:
- `progress`: A number between 0 and 100 representing the percentage of the savings goal completed.

### **GoalCard**

Displays individual savings goal information, including the goal name, target amount, saved amount, and a progress bar.

#### Props:
- `goalName`: The name of the savings goal.
- `targetAmount`: The target amount for the goal.
- `savedAmount`: The current amount saved toward the goal.

### **HomeScreen**

The main screen of the app, displaying the savings goal with the progress bar.

### **GoalListScreen**

A screen that displays all the goals in the app as a list of goal cards.

## Usage

1. **Create a Savings Goal**: Enter the name of the goal, the target amount, and the current saved amount.
2. **Track Progress**: As you save money, update the saved amount, and see the progress reflected in the progress bar.
3. **View All Goals**: Navigate to the Goal List Screen to view all goals.

### Example

1. Define a savings goal for a vacation:
   - **Goal Name**: "Vacation Fund"
   - **Target Amount**: $5,000
   - **Saved Amount**: $1,500

2. The app will display a progress bar showing that you're 30% toward your goal.
